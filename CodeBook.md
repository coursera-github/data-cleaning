## Source information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
The embedded accelerometer and gyropscope captured information at a rate of 50Hz, and the data was labelled.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window).
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
Features were normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

# Tidy Dataset

The tidy dataset is a rectangular space-delimited flat file containing the following feature set.
The activity and subject features are provided as to identify the task and individual.
The remaining features are NUMERICAL CONTINUOUS features, relating the the mean and standard deviation of the value indicated in the feature name.
For example, `tGravityAcc-mean()` is the mean gravitiational accelleration.
Note that the data has been normalized, so the value occurs in the range [-1, 1], rather than the "typical" units of N/m^2.
